# Week 5 Part 1

## Docker

Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. For this part, we have to run Canchu project on EC2 machines by docker.

#### What to Do:
1. Run MySQL in a docker container.
2. Run Canchu in a docker container.
3. Connect containers to a network. You can connect a container by name or by ID. Once connected, the container can communicate with other containers in the same network.
4. Run Nginx in a docker container. After that, you can connect your server from outside.


#### Advanced Optional & Discussion
* What is Docker, and what are its main advantages?
* Data will lose after closing container, how to resolve it?
* How to optimize dockerfile?
