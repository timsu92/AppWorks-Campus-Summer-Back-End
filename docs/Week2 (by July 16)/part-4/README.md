# Week 2 Part 4

## Build Search User's API

Today, we will revisit the User Search API because during the search, we also need to determine the friendship status between users.

### Build User Search API

Refer to [User Search API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#user-search-api), build this API for front-end. To implement the User Search API, you can input a keyword and compare it against the names of users in the database. If there is a match, you need to return the corresponding data. Additionally, you will need to perform a JOIN operation with the friendship relationship table to determine the relationship between the two individuals.

Note: No pagination is required here. Pagination exercises will be covered in later stages of API learning.
