# Week 2 Part 2

## Build Friend APIs

Today, we will handle friend-related operations.

### Build Friends Agree API

Refer to [Friend Agree API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#friends-agree-api), build this API for front-end. The user who has been invited to become a friend can agree to become friends.


### Build Delete Friend API

Refer to [Delete Friend API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#delete-friend-api), build this API for front-end. 

This API has two functionalities:

1. The person who invited someone to become a friend can withdraw the invitation.
2. Both parties who have become friends can delete the friendship relationship.
