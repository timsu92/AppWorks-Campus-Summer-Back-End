# Week 1 Part 1

## Build User APIs

It's time to build member system for our website.

### Build User Sign Up APIs

Refer to [User Sign Up API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#user-sign-up-api), and build this API for front-end.

Note:

I will use the following account for testing:
```
{
    "name": "user-{random 8 characters}",
    "email": "user-{random 8 characters}@test.com",
    "password": "test"
}
```
The conditions are as follows:

All fields (name, email, password) must be entered.
None of the fields should be empty.
The email field must be a valid email address.
It should not be possible to register with a duplicate email."
