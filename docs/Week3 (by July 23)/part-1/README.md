## Build Like and Comment APIs

Add the functionalities for liking posts and leaving comments.

### Build Post Create Like API

Refer to [Post Create Like API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#post-create-like-api), build this API for front-end. Each user can post on their own timeline or wall. Users can press the "Like" button for posts that they haven't liked yet.


### Build Post Delete Like API
Refer to [Post Update API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#post-delete-like-api), build this API for front-end. Users can retract their "Like" from content they have already liked.


### Build Post Create Comment API
Refer to [Post Create Comment API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#post-create-comment-api), build this API for front-end. Users can leave multiple comments on a single post.
