# Week 3 Part 3

## Build Post APIs

### Build Post Search API

Refer to [Post Search API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#post-search-api), build this API for front-end. 

Users can search for other users' posts or their own timeline, and it is necessary to design a pagination mechanism for the search results.
