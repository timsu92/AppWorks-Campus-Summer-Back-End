# Week 4 Part 5

## Stabilization and Optimization

I guess you are in a big mess now, but it's quite a chance to make everything better.

Check the list below to review and optimize your code and database.

1. Did you name your variables, functions and modules correctly?
2. Is there any code block repeating again and again in your system?
3. Did you verify all the request inputs before you use them in a critical procedure?
4. Did you give proper error message and status code back to client when something goes wrong?
5. Did you setup primary key, necessary indexes and foreign keys for every database table?
6. Did you define the proper data type and size for every table column?
7. Is your code designed with a good extensibility?
8. Is your code readable? Did you keep a consistent coding style?
9. Have you written proper documentation, such as a README? Did you tell your audience how to install and use your project?
10. Did you update `.env.example` or `.env.template`?

**The last question is: do you really know what you have done in the past 4 weeks?**
