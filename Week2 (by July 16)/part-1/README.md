# Week 2 Part 1

## Build Friend APIs

Next, we will start developing friend-related features and APIs.


### Build Friends Request API

Refer to [Friend Request API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#friends-request-api), build this API for front-end. Users can invite each other to become friends by using their respective user's id.


### Build Friends Agree API

Refer to [Friend Pending API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Canchu#friends-pending-api), build this API for front-end. The user who is invited to become a friend can use this API to identify who has invited them to be friends.
