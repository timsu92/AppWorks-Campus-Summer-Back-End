# Week 6 Part 1

## Monitoring

Monitoring the proper functioning of our services is crucial, so we usually establish a backend system to monitor the current status of the servers. In this part, we need to utilize the existing tools Prometheus + Grafana to implement this.

## Steps

1. Please start by reading the official documentation for Prometheus and Grafana.
2. You can install them using Docker (recommended) or install them locally.
3. Try modifying your code to monitor the usage status of requests and display the counts of status_code 200, 400, and 500.

## Note:
Assignment Submission Method: You need to create a dashboard in Grafana in advance. Additionally, you must provide me with the URL to your Grafana backend, along with the account credentials (username and password).

## Discussion:
1. What is the purpose of monitoring the services, and why is it crucial for the proper functioning of our applications?
2. What are Prometheus and Grafana, and how do they contribute to the monitoring process?
3. How can you implement monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana, and what specific metrics can be collected and visualized on the Grafana dashboard?
